# Class Library

## Purpose
The general idea for this repository is to serve as a single location library for common data structures


## Goals/Objectives
+ Commonly believed *MUST KNOW* data structures should be included, e.g. linked lists, trees
+ Data structures will be implemented as classes in C++
+ While not required, templating is encouraged in classes to handle multiple primitives for data
+ I would like this project to demonstrate a TDD style as much as possible (tools may change)
